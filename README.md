# Flipper
An app that lets businesses "stream" salaries to their employees. By streaming, we mean continuous payments per hour, minute, day etc. The time interval is chosen by the admin, but it has to be a multiple of 5 due to [xDai](https://blockscout.com/poa/dai) block times.

After the stream starts, an employee can withdraw funds from the contract at any point in time (block height) to get the money in their account. Therefore, we propose a new economic model where agents are paid continuously rather than in chunks once - per month or per week.

WARNING! This is not production-ready software. The project was bootstrapped in merely a weekend at the Status CryptoLife Hackathon held at The National House Smichov, Prague, 26-28th October 2018.
